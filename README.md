# PDF Merger
A PDF merger tool that combines all PDFs found in a given directory and deletes the original PDFs.
## Setup
Before using the program, install the PyPDF2 library by running the following command:
```Linux
pip install PyPDF2
```
## Usage
To start the program, run the following command in your terminal:
```Linux
python3 /location/to/pdf-merger
```
This will prompt you to enter a directory path:
```Linux
directory: /path/to/directory
```
After providing a valid path, the program will combine all the PDFs into a single file called "combined.pdf" and delete the original PDFs.
